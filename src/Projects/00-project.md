# Picking a Project
In MKProjects you may choose to help in a project currently being worked on, or propose a project 
you would like to do. In this section we will give an explanation on how to start doing either ones, 
and keep in mind the whole goal is to be open-source and non-profit, however if you have an idea that includes
making profit, then you will need to provide a proper presentation, and clear plan (A profitable project can get complicated, and MKProjects may use a royalty form of payment). 

## Getting Started with a Current Project 
Currently the projects being worked on is: 
- Tomorrow's Study
- MKProjects 
- Phaktionz

MKProjects is the main website that holds all the projects, and will always need 
some type of update for it's content, or cleaner layout. For the MKProjects website, 
all you'll need to know is the following: 
- HTML5
- CSS
- Markdown
- Git

_The other projects have their own section to be looked at_  

## Getting Started with your Own Project
When you want to make your own project, it will need to be proposed to me, Mustafif Khan, 
and I would like to know some of the following: 

- Project Name
- Profit/Non-Profit
- Purpose 
- Summary on what it does 
- Your idea of how it can be implemented 
- How others can contribute 

These are some of the things I would like discussed, and if you're not a programmer, but 
your project needs software development, please tell us how you would like it to be like, and 
we will figure out if it is possible.
