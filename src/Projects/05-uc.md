# UniConv

UniConv or Unit Converter is a basic Unit Converter Command Line program. This program contains the same parameters for all
the functions, and is being worked to have the following modes: 

- Temperature Conversions 
- Length Conversions 
- Time Conversions 
- Mass Conversions 
- Speed Conversions 

It has a simple approach when you do the program: 
```bash
$ uniconv <mode> <unit> <conversion>
# Let's convert 90 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius 
$ uniconv temp 90 fahr_to_cels
# Need a list of all the modes and conversions
$ uniconv list 
```

Working on this project would mean expanding this library a lot more, and 
enabling various modes of conversion.
