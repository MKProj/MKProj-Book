# Phaktionz
Phaktionz is a new way to look into Trading Card Games, with the drive of having a more open-source community behind the development of the game. 
This is one of the only projects that is aimed to be a profit project, however that is outside of the MKProject's line. Many of the rules and
story is shown to be open-source so we can get opinions from the community, and make it a game that can have the play style of everyone. 

In terms of _Content_ and _Development_, we have the following projects, respectively:
